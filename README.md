End-to-End DevOps Pipeline Project
This repository contains an end-to-end DevOps pipeline designed to automate code integration, deployment, and infrastructure provisioning. It leverages industry-standard tools like Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, and Git to achieve seamless, reliable, and repeatable deployments.

Project Overview
This project showcases the implementation of a fully automated CI/CD pipeline aimed at delivering software faster, with fewer errors, and in a scalable manner.

Key Features
Automated Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) pipeline.
Containerized application deployment using Docker.
Orchestrated workloads with Kubernetes for high availability and scalability.
Infrastructure as Code (IaC) provisioning using Terraform.
Integrated version control and collaboration via Git.
Troubleshooting and optimization for reliable delivery workflows.
Tech Stack
Tools Used:
Jenkins: For CI/CD automation.
Docker: To containerize the application for consistent deployment across environments.
Kubernetes: For container orchestration and scaling.
Terraform: For managing infrastructure as code.
Git: For version control and collaboration.
Pipeline Workflow
Code Integration

Code changes are pushed to a Git repository.
Jenkins triggers an automated build.
Build & Test

The application is built and containerized using Docker.
Unit tests and integration tests are executed to ensure code quality.
Infrastructure Provisioning

Terraform provisions cloud resources (e.g., compute, storage, networking).
Deployment

Kubernetes deploys containerized applications to the target environment.
Monitoring & Feedback

Logs and metrics are collected to monitor the health of deployments.
Achievements
Automated Workflow: Streamlined development and deployment processes, ensuring faster delivery.
Hands-On Troubleshooting: Identified and resolved bottlenecks in the pipeline.
Optimized Deployments: Implemented best practices to enhance the pipeline's efficiency.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Tools: Install Docker, Kubernetes CLI, Terraform CLI, and Jenkins.
Access: Ensure you have access to a cloud provider (AWS, Azure, or GCP).
